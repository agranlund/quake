1.03
====

- a real networking support! (ported from TyrQuake project)

- used standard XBIOS call for both VGA and RGB resolution setting

- decreased memory usage to 32 MB (IMO, still much more than needed)

- preliminary SuperVidel support (screen buffers are placed into SV memory
  instead of the slow ST-RAM but the C2P process still takes a place)

1.02
====

- triple-buffer support => smoother, flickerless rendering

- palette update does in vbl only (not waiting for vbl) => smoother rendering

- added "loading icon"

- killed -frametime parameter, replaced with value from 200 Hz system timer


1.01
====

- fixed bug with setting RGB resolution

- compiled with gcc-3.3.6 -m68060 -O3 => better performance (maybe ;)

- HELP/UNDO keys renamed back to F11/F12 (to make .cfg files happy)

- added m68k sprite drawing routine from another amiga port => better speed

- support for another version of shareware edition (thanks to Patrice Mandin)

- sound system is now stored and restored completely

- mouse is handled in more sensible way (moving forward doesn't look like snail :)
