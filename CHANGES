1.01
====

- fixed bug with setting RGB resolution

- compiled with gcc-3.3.6 -m68060 -O3 => better performance (maybe ;)

- HELP/UNDO keys renamed back to F11/F12 (to make .cfg files happy)

- added m68k sprite drawing routine from another amiga port => better speed

- support for another version of shareware edition (thanks to Patrice Mandin)

- sound system is now stored and restored completely

- mouse is handled in more sensible way (moving forward doesn't look like snail :)
